Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <MONEY> in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on <MONEY>,
I thought I would <READ> about a little and see the <BEAUTIFUL> part of the <NEIGHBORHOOD>.

It is a way I have of driving off the <ROAD> and regulating circulation.
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <LOSS>;
whenever it is a <COLD>, <DISMAL> November in my <HOMETOWN>;
whenever I find myself involuntarily <STANDING> before coffin <GRAVESTONE>,
and bringing up the rear of every <BOX> I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
that it requires a <CONSCIENTIOUS> moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <TRESPASSING> into the <HOUSES>,
and methodically <BREAKING> people's <WINDOWS> off—then,
I account it high time to get to <JAIL> as soon as I can.

There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it,
almost all <SUBJECTS> in their degree,
some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <MONEY> with me.
Still, theft does not justify my greed,
and I understand that now.

The end.
